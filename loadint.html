                          <p>Germany's upcoming election sees the conservative CDU, led by Friedrich Merz, poised to oust Chancellor Olaf Scholz.  Elon Musk has endorsed the right-wing AfD party as a solution to Germany's economic and immigration challenges, sparking controversy and accusations of election interference.  The AfD is expected to significantly increase its vote share, though Merz has stated he will not form a coalition with them.  Key issues include migration, economic stability, and security, with the CDU, even as it reorients towards the right, will likely maintain strong support for Ukraine.</p>

                          </h3>
                          <p>Following President Trump's reimposition of sanctions, a high-ranking Iranian general vowed to launch an attack to destroy Israel.  Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar responded, emphasizing the seriousness of such threats.  The Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) General stated that "Operation True Promise 3" would be executed to "raze Tel Aviv and Haifa to the ground."  The comments are seen as a potential challenge to Trump, who previously ordered the strike that killed IRGC General Qassem Soleimani.</p>

                          <p>Nigel Farage, leader of the UK's Reform UK party, believes a "political revolution" similar to the one that saw Donald Trump's election in the US will spread across Europe.  He praised VP JD Vance's controversial remarks at the Munich Security Conference, suggesting Vance was "speaking ahead of his time."  Farage argues that a growing anti-establishment sentiment is boosting support for parties like Reform UK, which he claims is gaining significant traction in the polls.</p>

The release included civilians held for over a decade, along with others captured more recently.  The IDF confirmed the hostages' arrival in Israel.
