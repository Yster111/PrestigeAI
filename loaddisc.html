                    <h2>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vows to bring 'the savages who executed our hostages' to justice</h2>
                    <p>Hamas returned the bodies of multiple hostages, but discrepancies arose regarding the remains of Shiri Bibas. Two of the bodies were identified as her children, Ariel and Kfir. A fourth body was also returned. Netanyahu and other Israeli officials have vowed to continue efforts to bring the remaining, and properly identified, hostages and remains, home, and to hold Hamas accountable. The IDF stated that the young Bibas children weren't shot, but killed by hand.</p>
                    <p>Further, Hamas said it delivered an additional body to the Red Cross and says it is Shiri Bibas. This follows the earlier delivery of a body claimed to be Bibis, but later identified as a different woman.</p>

                    <h2>Trump says Starmer and Macron 'haven't done anything' to end Ukraine war</h2>
                    <p>Ahead of visits from UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron, Donald Trump criticized them for not doing enough to end the war in Ukraine. He also criticized Ukrainian President Zelensky, suggesting he had "no cards" in negotiations. Despite his criticism, Trump also praised both European leaders. This comes as European leaders met in Paris to discuss the conflict and amid concerns about being excluded from US-Russia talks.</p>

                    <h2>Apple finally launches its in-house modem with iPhone 16e</h2>
                    <p>Apple has unveiled its first in-house modem chip with the iPhone 16e, reducing reliance on Qualcomm. The new modem, part of the 'C1 subsystem,' is designed to improve performance, efficiency, and battery life and integrates closely with Apple's other chips. Initial limitations include the lack of millimeter-wave 5G support, an area where Qualcomm still holds an advantage. This signifies a major step towards Apple's hardware independence.</p>

                    <p>Germany faces a potential political shift as the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party is predicted to become the second-largest political force in the upcoming elections. The AfD, labeled "radical" and "anti-democratic" by opponents, shares similarities with Donald Trump's policies. Germany's economic struggles, military weakness, and concerns about migration are contributing factors to the AfD's rise in popularity.</p>
