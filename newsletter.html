                  US and Russian officials met in Saudi Arabia to discuss improving relations and ending the war in Ukraine, without Ukrainian representatives.  The meeting, led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, marks a significant step by the Trump administration to reverse US policy on isolating Russia. Ukrainian officials were not included, and President Zelenskyy stated Kyiv will not accept the outcome without their participation. Former defense intelligence officer Rebekah Koffler noted that Zelenskyy's absence is due to his presidency "expiring in May."

                While President Trump facilitates Ukraine peace talks, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) plays a crucial role as host. MBS's leadership balances bold reforms with authoritarian tactics, reshaping Saudi Arabia's domestic and foreign policies, including closer ties with both Russia and China, while maintaining a pragmatic relationship with Israel, and mediating in international conflicts.

                  With the Israel-Hamas ceasefire nearing its end, Israeli military experts discuss potential responses if the agreement collapses.  President Trump's threats to unleash "hell" on Hamas suggest a full-scale military operation.  Scenarios could include intense airstrikes, expanded ground operations, and cutting off essential supplies to Gaza. The Trump administration's lifting of restrictions on heavy bombs signals a potential escalation in military action.
