                      <p style="color: #333; line-height: 1.5;">Germany's upcoming election sees the conservative CDU, led by Friedrich Merz, poised to oust Chancellor Olaf Scholz.  Elon Musk has endorsed the right-wing AfD party as a solution to Germany's economic and immigration challenges, sparking controversy and accusations of election interference.  The AfD is expected to significantly increase its vote share, though Merz has stated he will not form a coalition with them.  Key issues include migration, economic stability, and security, with the CDU, even as it reorients towards the right, will likely maintain strong support for Ukraine.</p>
